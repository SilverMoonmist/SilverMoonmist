<h3>Hello, my name is CÃ¡ssio Vianna</h3>
<h4>But I go by SilverMoonmist, Silverpelt or simply Silver on the web, a nickname I adopted from a MTG card from Innistrad.</h4>

<p>That alone might tell you a bit about me. I am currently begginning my studies in programming and still not sure what path I'd like to take. As far as development is concerned I'm really interested in the reaches of web dev, but I'm also into software dev and mainly Game Dev, as I've studied Game Design in the past. I'm still a begginer, but I'm eager to learn more, as knowledge is something that drives me.</p>
